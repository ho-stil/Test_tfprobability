# Introduction

Run some Tests on the Keras interface to tfprobability. 

## Confidence Interval

Compare confidence intervals to linear regression results, loess, and quantile random forest for very simple problem: 1-3 predictors with normal ditributed availability and linear/quadratic responce (plus some noise). Check which model generates which kind of confidence interval. Most important / key feature after experience with quantile randnom forest: for local models the confidence intervalls for extrapolation should get very wide.

## Performance as compared to tensorflow

Use some standard-problems (chose the ones from RStudio-Keras website) to benchmark tprobability vs tensorflow. Is it worth the additional effort?
