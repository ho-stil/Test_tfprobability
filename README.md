# Test_tfprobability

Run some tests on confidence-intervals in neuralnetworks via tfprobability in R.
Compare error-levels to 

1. linear regression model,
2. loess smoother, and 
2. quantile random forest model.

Just try what it can do for production related questions in a mamnufacturing environment.
